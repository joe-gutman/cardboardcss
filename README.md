  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</div>
```
You can customize the appearance further by combining classes or adjusting element sizes and content.

```html
<div class="paper cut-1">
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</div>
```

<b><i>Example:</i></b> div with a cardboard texture and a bottom border that shows the wavy inner structure.
```html
<div class="cardboard bottom">
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</div>
```



### Classes
Here are some of the core classes provided by Cardboard.CSS:

- `.cardboard`: Adds a cardboard texture to an element.
  - If you add a `.top` or `.bottom` class in addition to `.cardboard`, it will add border that shows the wavy inner structure of cardboard.
- `.paper`: Applies a paper-like texture to an element.
- `.cut-[1-4]`: make the edges of an element look as if they were cut by scissors.
- `.distort-[1-4]`: slightly rotates ands skews the element making it look as if it was placed by hand.
